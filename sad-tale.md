House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned, Jon and Tyrion ride dragons into battle against the white walkers and
incinerate them all in about five minutes. Danaerys feeds all the poor people
in Flea Botto and teaches them to be developers so they never go hungry again.
